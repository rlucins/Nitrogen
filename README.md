# Nitrogen
A Discord Nitro key generator and validator/checker.

This tool will do the following to generate and validate these codes.
* Python script generates a random combination of numbers.
* After that, it will navigate to the Discord redeeming website and input the code.
* If it is invalid, it generates a new one, inputs it in the Discord website, etc...
* BUT if it is valid, it will note it down in a text file or something.

Please keep in mind that this tool is upcoming and it will not be finished so soon as you may think! :)
